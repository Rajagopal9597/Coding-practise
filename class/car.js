/*Car
Define a class named Car, which should have the name and model as the properties. You don't need to worry about input/output and object of the class. The given template will take care of it.

The input will contain the name and model. Their default values should be Audi and A4 respectively.

Input
First line contains an integer, either 1 or -1. If the first line is 1, then:

One line containing two space separated values, denoting name and model respectively.
Output
Print name and model in newline each.

Example
Input1:

1
Ford C4
Output1:

Ford
C4
Input2:

-1
Output2:

A4
Explanation
Example 1

First line is 1, which denotes space separated values as input to the class.

Ford C4 denotes the values for name and model respectively and we print name and model in new line each.

Example 2

First line is -1, which denotes we need to print the default values line by line.*/
