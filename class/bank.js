/*Bank Account Credit and Debit -- Classes Practice Problems
Write a bank account class (BankAccount). It should have an instance variable called balance which holds the current value. Assume initial balance is 0. The class should have the following methods: credit and debit.

credit - takes an integer (>= 0) as input and increases the balance by that amount
debit - takes an integer (>= 0) as input and decreases the balance by that amount
Input
The first line contains an integer n, denoting the number of transactions. This is followed by n lines each containing 2 space separated inputs. The first input is either c (denoting credit) or d (denoting debit). The second input is a non-negative integer denoting the amount.

Note: You don't have to worry about reading input or printing output. The code for that is already provided.

Output
One integer, denoting the final balance of the account.

Example
Input:

3
c 100
c 500
d 200
Output:

400
The first line in input is 3, denoting 3 transactions.
First transaction is c 100, which means a credit of 100. So the balance will become 100 (because initial balance is 0).
Second transaction is c 500, which means a credit of 500. So the balance becomes 100 + 500 which is 600.
Third transaction is d 200, which means a debit of 200. So balance becomes 600 - 200, which is 400.
So, the final balance is 400.  */
